# Infinite Scroll

Continually renders a small number of rows as if they're the rows you would be looking at if all the rows were rendered.

This works by continually moving the rows once they're out of view to where you are about to scroll to.

Last holiday I studied someone else's VanillaJS that demonstrated this and now I'm doing it here but probably slower because it's using a framework.
